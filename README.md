# Password Generator  
In this day and age, protecting our digital lives is crucial. Simple passwords like birthdays, pets’ names, or “1234” just don’t cut it because they’re easy to guess and unsafe.  
This project taught me how to create a **random password generator** that combines letters, numbers, and symbols to generate strong, unpredictable passwords for better security.  

## What I learned
- Using Python’s `random` module to shuffle and select characters  
- Working with lists, loops, and string manipulation  
- Building user‑friendly programs that solve real‑world problems  

## How to run
1. Click the green **Code** button → **Download ZIP** → unzip the folder.  
2. Run `password_generator.py` with Python.
